## Skills:

### SQL:
- Advanced Querying: Complex joins, window functions, CTEs, subqueries, pivot/unpivot, and aggregation techniques for in-depth data analysis and transformation.

- Performance Optimization: Proficient in query tuning, indexing strategies, execution plans, and optimizing large-scale data queries.

- Data Modeling: Experience designing normalized and denormalized schemas (star/snowflake), creating ER diagrams, and understanding relational data structures.

- ETL Development: Writing and maintaining SQL-based ETL/ELT processes for transforming and loading data into warehouses (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift).

- SQL in Analytics & Engineering: Used SQL for both analytical dashboards and backend pipeline logic—bridging data insights with engineering best practices.

- Version Control & CI/CD: Experience managing SQL scripts with Git and integrating into CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments.

### Python:
- Python for Data Engineering: Proficient in writing clean, modular, and scalable Python code for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL/ELT), automation scripts, and API integrations.

- PySpark: Experience with distributed data processing using PySpark for large-scale data transformations, performance tuning, and working with DataFrames and RDDs in a production context.

- Apache Airflow: Designed and scheduled DAGs for orchestrating complex ETL pipelines; comfortable with task dependencies, retries, and custom operators.

- Docker: Containerized Python applications and workflows for reproducibility and deployment across environments. Familiar with Dockerfiles, multi-stage builds, and container networking.

- Kubernetes: Understanding of container orchestration, managing Docker containers using Kubernetes for scalable and resilient data workflows.

- Data Pipelines & Workflow Automation: Built batch and streaming pipelines using Python with tools like Airflow, Spark, and custom schedulers.

- Testing & Code Quality: Experience with unit testing (pytest), logging, and monitoring for data pipelines to ensure robustness and observability.

### Libraries & Tools:

- Core Libraries: pandas, NumPy, SQLAlchemy, requests, datetime, os, pathlib

- Data Engineering Tools: PySpark, Airflow, dbt, 

- DevOps Tools: Docker, Kubernetes, Git, CI/CD tools (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)

### Data Visualization
- Communicating data stories
- Visualization through graphs
- Simplifying complex ideas into interpretable pieces and combining to construct a narrative.
