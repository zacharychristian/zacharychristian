## Skills:

### Data Visualization
- Communicating data stories
- Visualization through graphs
- Simplifying complex ideas into interpretable pieces and combining to construct a narrative.

### SQL:
Advanced Querying: Complex joins, window functions, CTEs, subqueries, pivot/unpivot, and aggregation techniques for in-depth data analysis and transformation.

Performance Optimization: Proficient in query tuning, indexing strategies, execution plans, and optimizing large-scale data queries.

Data Modeling: Experience designing normalized and denormalized schemas (star/snowflake), creating ER diagrams, and understanding relational data structures.

ETL Development: Writing and maintaining SQL-based ETL/ELT processes for transforming and loading data into warehouses (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift).

SQL in Analytics & Engineering: Used SQL for both analytical dashboards and backend pipeline logicâ€”bridging data insights with engineering best practices.

Version Control & CI/CD: Experience managing SQL scripts with Git and integrating into CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments.

### Python:
- Multiple projects that required aggregating and preparing data from diverse datasets
- Experience with packages such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.
- Multiple Data Science projects completed using Python
- Data Structures and Algorithms.

### Machine Learning:
- Experience with Natural Language Processing, High Level Data Visualization, Neural Networks, Optimization, etc.
- Supervised Learning: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, KNN ( K Nearest Neighbor), Neural Network, Naive Bayes, etc.
- Unsupervised learning: Hierarchical clustering, KMeans, Gaussian Mixture model, DBScan, PCA (Principal Component Analysis), SVD (Singular Value Decomposition),  t-SNE (T Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding), etc.
- Various types of optimization such as Gradient Descent, Expectation Maximization, Exhaustive Search, Boosting, Bagging, etc.
- Visualization techniques 
- Utilizing pipelines for more generalizable and readable code
- Random sampling from probability density functions (Monte Carlo Simulations)
